# Understanding common vulnerabilityies and how to remeditae them

## SQL Injection



## Should password be hashed server-side or client-side?

If someone can listen for your plain text password is certainly also able to listen for hashed password, and use these captured hashes to authenticate against your server.

When HTTPS is in use, the register request is already encrypted, hashing password is redundant.

If TLS is in use, the client-side hash offers very little. 

The main purpose of storing a hash is to help protect the application against an attacker gaining credentials by reading the authentication data. If the passwords is irreversible the attacker can't pass it to the server for authentication.

## If web data is sent encrypted why is it that tools like Burp can intercept it in the clear?

Normal HTTPS traffic
Client |---HTTPS--Req--->| Server

Client |<---Certification---| Server

Verity Cert

Client |<---SSL Negotiation--->| Server

Client |<---Security Connection--->| Server

Client |---HTTPS--Req--->| Server

With Burp
By install Burp's certification. Burp owns two key pairs. One pair is for browser and the other one is for the target server.
